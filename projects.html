        Over the course of October 2022 to even now, I'm putting updates into this game purely for the fun. It started as a little project of mine that got out of hand.

    <h3>2. Subreddit Web Crawler and Scraper</h3>
    <h4>What was used: Python, MongoDB, Flask, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Urllib, Reddit </h4>

    <p>Description:
        Yes, there is a Reddit API that can get me this data easily, but I learned how to make web crawlers from a web search course in school. I was intrigued and wanted to see where I could
        possibly pull data from. Fueled by this need just try it for myself, I quickly ran into the issue of domains. Everywhere my frontier went was restricted to open so nothing was getting collected.
        I decided to search for a specific domain, perhaps to create a vertical search engine, and found myself on www.reddit.com. I am an avid user of reddit, and I think there are solid topics for any category
        of discussion with lots of specific detail within subreddits. That helped me decide to crawl specifically for urls containing: "www.reddit.com/r/{subredditName}". After successfully multithreading
        the crawling logic, I was able to get around 1.4k documents(subreddits) in the database in around 30 minutes. I understand if I spent more time on the crawl logic it's definitely possible to crawl a large portion
        of subreddits in Reddit. For example, if I were to start the frontier from multiple points of Reddit instead of one corner. I essentially "bottlenecked" myself by cutting the crawl to only one corner.
        Once the subreddits were saved, I have a subredditParser.py where I scrape or parse the subreddit pages. I initially used BeautifulSoup and Urllib to open the link and take data, but I ran into an issue
        where the subreddit web page was dynamic and loaded content later than subredditParser.py scraped it. Meaning, the data collected was null, so I used Selenium to open an instance of the web page,
        wait 4 seconds for the content to certainly load, then collect what we need with BeautifulSoup, and store it back into a new collection in MongoDB. After I successfully scraped each subreddit, I was kind
        of at loss with what to do with all of this data. I had the subreddit name, the description of it, subscribers, current users, and random images. This is when the project gets less serious and I throw my weird twist on it
        and I decided to search for "cat-like words" in each subreddit. I like cats, and I was genuinely curious which subreddits discussed or consisted of cat content more than others. So I came up with a list of cat words, tied weights
        to each word (by my own personal belief of if that word relates more to a cat), counted the occurrences of list words in each subreddit, and gave each subreddit a calculated "Cat Document Score". This was with the intention
        of creating a "Cat Subreddit Search Engine" with my own collected data, but if I'm being 100% honest I had created a cosine similarity based search engine in a class that same week, so I stopped here and just displayed
        the data using Flask to a random website I made for fun. It runs locally, so I sometimes play it and leave it on my screen like a screensaver. I always find a new subreddit I didn't see before.
